Thanks for downloading Awesomium 1.6.5 for Linux 64-bit!

Here's a couple tips for using Awesomium on Linux:

You'll need to define your own scrollbars using CSS, please
see this support article for more information:

http://support.awesomium.com/kb/general-use/how-do-i-style-custom-scrollbars

To install Awesomium, you'll need to add the shared library to your
system's library search path. On Ubuntu, you can use the following commands:

    cd awesomium_v1.6.5_sdk_linux32
    sudo mkdir /usr/lib/awesomium-1.6.5
    sudo cp -r build/bin/release/* /usr/lib/awesomium-1.6.5
    sudo ldconfig /usr/lib/awesomium-1.6.5

To link against Awesomium, you should use "-lawesomium-1.6.5", for example:

    g++ main.cpp -lawesomium-1.6.5 -o MyApp

To build the samples, just cd into /samples/projects/linux and run:
    make all

To build the WebFlow demo, you'll need to install SDL and then, just
cd into /samples/WebFlow/projects/linux and run:
    make all

To use Awesomium with Mono/C#, we've included the Mono component of our
Awesomium.NET library, see wrappers/Awesomium.Mono/README
